## What is Gyroflow

**Gyroflow** is a cross-platform post-stabilization tool that aligns **gyro data** with footage to compute accurate transforms and compensate for shake. It ingests IMU tracks from action cameras and flight controllers (GoPro/DJI/Sony/Insta360, Betaflight/INAV Blackbox), maintaining natural motion, controlled crop, and reliable horizon lock for FPV, action, inspection, and cinematic workflows.

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Auto sync** by audio/flash markers/time; manual offsets when needed.  
- 🧠 **Camera/lens models** with distortion tables, FOV, rolling-shutter presets and custom calibration.  
- 🧭 **Axis control**: stabilize yaw/pitch/roll independently, clamp angles, horizon lock.  
- 🧮 **Filters**: trajectory smoothing, dead-zone, accel limits, adaptive curves.  
- 📤 **Export**: ProRes/H.264/H.265, LUT compatibility, project/track export.

## Advanced Capabilities

- 🛰️ **Log import**: Blackbox (Betaflight/INAV), CSV/IMU from cameras, embedded gyro metadata.  
- 📈 **Pipeline**: lens/RS calibration, preview, batch rendering, reproducible presets.  
- 🧩 **Integrations**: NLE round-trips (Resolve/Adobe) through exports.  
- 🔧 **Automation**: CLI for large-scale processing.
